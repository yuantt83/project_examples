Synopsis:

This project aims to train different CNN  models to automatically identify spiral-arm galaxies vs non-spiral galaxies. 
This is a side project for my astrophysical work <br/>


This folder contains:<br/>

1. README<br/>
2. dataset: galaxy images used for training and testing. Files too large to upload to here, so only single testing images are included. <br/>
3. group_data.ipynb: a data preprocessing code example to handle raw data downloaded from Kaggle.<br/>
3b. group_data.py:  executable python from .ipynb above.<br/>
4. cnn_spiral.ipynb: python  notebook template for buidling, training, testing a standard CNN.<br/>
4.1 cnn_spiral_model(n).py:  different models (current best is model-4) <br/>
4b. cnn_spiral.py: executable python code from .ipynb above. 
5. models: saved models
6. sqlcl.py: SDSS python SQL module
7. To-add: new results from transfer learning models!
