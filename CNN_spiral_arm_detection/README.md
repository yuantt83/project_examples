Synopsis:

This project aims to train a CNN to automatically identify spiral-arm galaxies vs non-spiral galaxies. This is a
side project for my astrophysical research <br/>


This folder contains:<br/>

1. README<br/>
2. dataset: galaxy images used for training and testing. Files too large to upload to here, so only single testing images are included. <br/>
3. group_data.ipynb: data preprocessing code from raw data downloaded from Kaggle.<br/>
3b. group_data.py:  executable python from .ipynb above.<br/>
4. cnn_spiral.ipynb: python code notebook for buidling, training, testing the CNN.<br/>
 > 4.1 cnn_spiral_model1-n.py: trying different models (still exploring for the best model...)
4b. cnn_spiral.py: executable python code from .ipynb above. 
5. models: saved models
6. sqlcl.py: SDSS python SQL module
